# Setup-file
A python script that I use to setup files for me

Set an enviroment variable to the address of setuppath.py so you can run it anywhere

Put whatever you want to setup into directory, then change the python script a bit and it'll work out fine, python will create the new file at the new directory you run the code in

Run python setuppath.py [OPTIONS] [DIR_NAME]
